                <h3>What is Cirntember?</h3>
                <p>
                    Cirntember is a month-long event taking place from September 1st - September 30th. Cirno is far too powerful for just one day, so I'm running a month of Cirno content to really celebrate my favourite Touhou character.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    The event is hosted primarily through my personal Twitter account, but this year I'm also launching my own Discord server to help co-ordinate things, and just as a nice place to hang out and share good vibes.
                </p>

                <h3>What happens in Cirntember?</h3>
                <p>
                    Every day, a new piece of Cirno-themed content will be posted on my Twitter account at 9PM BST (UTC+1)! Each piece made by a different creator! Last year, this was artwork and photographs, but this year I'm opening submissions to more types of original content.
                </p>
